First I created an account in the site: https://github.com/topics/login
The site asked me for my email-id
Then the site asked me to enter my username and checked if it is available or not
After the username step, the site asked me to create a strong password
After entering the password it forwared me to a page to enter verification code that was sent in my mail
Then it asked me about features that I want to use, give access to how many people, are you a student or teacher?, etc.
I created a repository in my account with public access and a Readme file
Then i clicked the "+" button and then the dropdown appeared of "Create new file" & "Upload File"
After selecting Create new file, it asked me to name it in main, and as instructed in assingment I named it as "Assingment-1" by adding a "/" after the name.
Then wrote a file named:"Steps to Create GitFolder and i am currently writing the steps to create gitfolder in the edit section
And will click the Commit Changes
